# CGS 3035 - Spring 2013
# PROJECT NUMBER: 3 
# DUE DATE: Tuesday 2/19/2013
# PLATFORM: Windows OS / Python 3.3.0
# 
# SUMMARY
#
# write a menu-driven program which allows a person to type in a command and
# an English unit of measurement, and convert the measurement to its
# equivalent in Metric units. This can be quite a useful application to
# have. Such a program is often incorporated into a small hand-held
# calculator, just as a foreign language dictionary (word for word can be.  
#
# INPUT
#
# All input will be interactive. You must ask the user to enter a command,
# and a numeric value for the measurement they want to convert. For example,
# if they enter a 2 for the command, then you would ask them to enter the
# number of feet they wish to convert to meters.

# The program must allow the user to enter menu commands and numbers to
# convert, until they choose to stop. You must use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to
# represent the commands.
#
# OUTPUT
#
# Your output must contain a menu - that is, you need to tell the user what
# the commands are and what they mean. Prompts and error messages should be
# printed as needed, and of course, the results of the conversion which was
# performed. Donâ€™t forget titles, headings, blank lines etc. as needed to
# make your output clear and informative. Print your real numbers to 3
# digits of precision.
#
# ASSUMPTIONS
#
# It is possible that the user may enter an invalid command, or a negative
# number of English units. Your program must check for both of these errors,
# and ask the user to re-enter a value when necessary, until a valid data
# item is entered.
#
# You should test your program with a wide variety of numeric values, some
# negative, some zero, and some positive. Also be sure to test all of the
# possible commands. The graders will also run your program to test it
# during the grading process. You may assume that the user enters a valid
# number when asked for a number (i.e. they won't type something which is
# a non-numeric value).
